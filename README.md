# Movie Analysis Project

Welcome to the Movie Analysis Project repository! In this project, we explore the characteristics of popular movies and analyze factors that contribute to their success and profitability. We use a dataset containing information about top-rated movies from 2003 to 2022, sourced from IMDb.
